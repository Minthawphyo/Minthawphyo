Hello, I'm Min Thaw Phyo, a junior Computer Vision Engineer and Web Developer based in Myanmar. My academic journey in computer science has equipped me with a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software development principles. I specialize in machine learning, particularly deep learning, with expertise in neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and their applications in computer vision tasks. I've worked extensively with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, gaining hands-on experience in tasks such as image segmentation, CNNs, RNNs and transfer learning. This proficiency contributes to a comprehensive understanding of deep learning intricacies in computer vision. Feel free to reach out for collaborations or opportunities; I'm excited to connect and contribute.
