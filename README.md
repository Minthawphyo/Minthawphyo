👋 Hello, I'm Min Thaw Phyo! I'm a passionate junior computer vision engineer and web developer from Myanmar. 💻

🎓 Currently pursuing my studies in computer science, I have a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software development principles. My curiosity and drive to learn have led me to specialize in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

👁️ With a keen interest in computer vision, I enjoy exploring image processing, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. I have experience in tasks like object detection, image classification, and facial recognition, utilizing tools like OpenCV.

💡 Additionally, I have honed my skills in web development, with proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular. I find joy in creating intuitive user interfaces and building responsive web applications.

🌍 I believe in the transformative power of technology and am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals on meaningful projects. I am open to contributing to open-source projects and expanding my skill set.

📫 Let's connect and explore possibilities together! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, potential collaborations, or exciting opportunities. I'm excited to grow and contribute in the dynamic world of computer vision and web development.
